1) Use/Benefit and Equation:

    a.) Why pointer arithmetic is useful/beneficial
        An pointer stores the address of an data. So we can use a pointer to trace data through pointer arithmetic in different address 
        and do not need to use the name of data to trace data every time.

    b.) The relationship between arrays and pointers
        The equation of pointer and array is in the following:
            int *pointer = &arrays[0]
        so, the pointer of an array is the address of first element in an array. I can use pointer arithmetic to trace 
        element in the array.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2) Steps:

    If I have two address, ptr1 and ptr2, and ptr2 is bigger then ptr1. so the difference between them is difference = ptr2 - ptr1
    However, because an address is 8 bytes, so the difference should be stored in an 8 bytes data type. So I use int to store difference and
    the form of address difference would be --> int difference = ptr2 - ptr1.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3) Explain:
    Becasue this is pass by reference, when I do the swap integer, I only need to swap the context in the two pointers
    and do not need to return anything. This is important for arrays becasue if I want to pass an array to a function, I only 
    need to pass the address of the array to the function and the length of an array will not be limited.
    If I pass by integer, the length of array will be limited and the use of function will be limited.
